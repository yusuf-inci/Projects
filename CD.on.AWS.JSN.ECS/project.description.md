- The "Continuous Delivery (Java App) with Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, Slack, Docker on AWS ECS" project is a comprehensive and advanced solution designed to facilitate the continuous delivery of Java applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This project builds upon the foundation established by its predecessor, the "Continuous Integration on AWS with Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, and Slack (CI.onAWS.JSNS)" project, and extends the capabilities by integrating additional tools such as Docker, Amazon ECR, AWS ECS, and Slack for a robust end-to-end delivery pipeline.   
- Prerequisites: Before embarking on this project, users are expected to have completed the Continuous Integration project on AWS. The tools leveraged in this project include Jenkins for automation, Nexus Sonatype Repository for managing Maven dependencies and artifacts, SonarQube for code analysis, Maven for building artifacts, Git for version control, Slack for team communication, Docker for containerization, ECR for storing containerized artifacts, ECS for container orchestration, and AWS CLI for AWS command-line interaction.

The "Continuous Delivery (Java App) with Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, Slack, Docker on AWS ECS" project is a comprehensive and advanced solution designed to facilitate the continuous delivery of Java applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This project builds upon the foundation established by its predecessor, the "Continuous Integration on AWS with Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, and Slack (CI.onAWS.JSNS)" project, and extends the capabilities by integrating additional tools such as Docker, Amazon ECR, AWS ECS, and Slack for a robust end-to-end delivery pipeline.

Prerequisites:
Before embarking on this project, users are expected to have completed the Continuous Integration project on AWS. The tools leveraged in this project include Jenkins for automation, Nexus Sonatype Repository for managing Maven dependencies and artifacts, SonarQube for code analysis, Maven for building artifacts, Git for version control, Slack for team communication, Docker for containerization, ECR for storing containerized artifacts, ECS for container orchestration, and AWS CLI for AWS command-line interaction.

Key Steps and Components:

Update GitHub Webhook with Jenkins IP:
Ensures secure integration by configuring GitHub webhooks with the IP of the Jenkins server.

Copying Docker Files:
Copies Docker files from a reference repository (vprofile) to the project repository, enabling Dockerization of the Java application.

Preparing Jenkinsfiles for Staging and Production:
Creates separate Jenkinsfiles for the staging and production environments, allowing tailored configurations for each stage of the delivery pipeline.

AWS Setup:
Guides users through essential AWS configurations, including IAM setup and ECR repository creation, ensuring secure access and storage of Docker images.

Jenkins Plugin Installation:
Installs critical Jenkins plugins such as Docker Pipeline, Cloudbees Docker Build and Publish, Amazon ECR, and Pipeline: AWS Steps for seamless integration with AWS services.

Docker Engine & AWS CLI Installation on Jenkins:
Ensures that Jenkins is equipped with Docker Engine and AWS CLI, vital for building, publishing, and deploying Docker images to AWS.

Write Jenkinsfile for Build & Publish Image to ECR:
Develops Jenkinsfiles that define the multi-stage Dockerfile, build and publish Docker images to Amazon ECR.

AWS ECS Setup (Cluster, Task Definition, Service):
Guides users through the creation of ECS clusters, task definitions, and services for both staging and production environments, leveraging AWS Fargate for container management.

Code for Deploying Docker Image to ECS:
Incorporates deployment code into Jenkinsfiles for deploying Docker images to ECS clusters, ensuring seamless deployment and orchestration.

Repeating Steps for Prod ECS Cluster:
Duplicates the setup steps for a production ECS cluster, reinforcing the consistency between staging and production environments.

Update IPs and Prepare Source Code:
Enforces security by validating security groups and updating IPs. Prepares the source code by creating branches and copying Docker files.

AWS IAM & ECR Setup:
Guides users through creating IAM users, setting up policies, and creating private ECR repositories for secure Docker image storage.

Jenkins Configurations:
Configures Jenkins by installing necessary plugins, storing AWS credentials securely, and testing pipeline execution.

Write Jenkinsfile for Deploying to ECS (Pipeline for ECS):
Enhances Jenkinsfiles with deployment stages for ECS, ensuring that Docker images are seamlessly deployed to ECS clusters.

Repeat Steps for Prod ECS Cluster:
Replicates the deployment steps for a production ECS cluster, maintaining consistency between environments.

In Real-Time Production Scenario:
Provides insights into how staging and production code branches are merged, triggering production pipelines and directing user requests to the production environment.

Clean-Up:
Offers guidance on cleaning up resources, including deleting ECS clusters and terminating Jenkins, Nexus, and SonarQube servers.

Conclusion:
This project serves as an invaluable guide for organizations seeking to establish a robust, secure, and automated continuous delivery pipeline for Java applications on AWS. By combining industry-leading tools and following best practices, users can achieve efficient and streamlined software delivery, from code commit to production deployment. The project's thorough documentation ensures that users can follow the steps with confidence, making it a valuable resource for DevOps teams aiming to optimize their delivery workflows.
